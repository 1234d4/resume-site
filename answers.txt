Assignment 1 – Short Answers

Question 1: What does the intrapage link do after you add it and click it?
Answer: It scrolls/jumps to the section on the same page that matches the anchor id (e.g., clicking “Skip down to my Education” moves to the element with id="education").

Question 2: Which type of list did you choose and why?
Answer: Unordered list, because skills don’t have a required order and bullets are clearer than numbers here.
